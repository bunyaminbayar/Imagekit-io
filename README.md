This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Live Demo

https://imagekit-tst.vercel.app/

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Comparison of ImageKit.io and Next.js `Image` Component

### Differences

1. **Image Optimization:**
   - **ImageKit.io:** Provides real-time image optimization. Images can be adjusted in size, format, and compression via URL parameters.
   - **Next.js `Image`:** Optimizes images primarily through server-side optimizations with more limited features.

2. **Image Processing:**
   - **ImageKit.io:** Supports advanced image processing such as cropping, rotation, and applying filters through URL parameters.
   - **Next.js `Image`:** Does not natively support advanced image processing; additional libraries or services may be required.

3. **CDN Integration:**
   - **ImageKit.io:** Delivers images via a global CDN, ensuring fast and reliable delivery.
   - **Next.js `Image`:** Uses local or configured CDN, which may require additional setup for external services.

4. **Image Formats:**
   - **ImageKit.io:** Supports various formats like WebP, JPEG, PNG, and can automatically select the best format for delivery.
   - **Next.js `Image`:** Support for formats like WebP may be limited and requires additional configuration for format conversion.

5. **Security and Access Control:**
   - **ImageKit.io:** Provides features for controlling image access and generating secure URLs.
   - **Next.js `Image`:** Security and access control require additional configuration.

### Features and Advantages of ImageKit.io

1. **Real-Time Optimization:** Images are optimized on-the-fly based on device and network conditions.
2. **Easy Integration:** Simple integration via API and URL-based methods.
3. **Advanced Image Processing:** Offers various image processing capabilities through URL parameters.
4. **Fast Delivery:** Ensures quick and efficient image delivery via a global CDN.
5. **Security Features:** Includes secure URL generation, access controls, and watermarking options.
6. **Media Management:** Provides centralized management and organization for easy handling of media files.

These features make ImageKit.io particularly beneficial for projects with large or dynamic media content.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
